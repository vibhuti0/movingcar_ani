To allow autoplay of audio on specific websites in Google Chrome, you can modify the site settings to permit autoplay. Here's how you can do it:

Steps to Allow Autoplay in Google Chrome:<br>
1.<strong>Open Chrome Settings:</strong>

Open Google Chrome and click the three vertical dots (menu) in the upper-right corner of the window.
Select Settings from the dropdown menu.<br>
2.<strong>Access Site Settings:</strong>

Scroll down and click on Privacy and security on the left-hand sidebar.
Under Privacy and security, select Site Settings.<br>
3.<strong>Manage Autoplay Permissions:</strong>

Scroll down and click on Additional content settings to expand the options.
Click on Sound.<br>
4.<strong>Enable Autoplay:</strong>

Under the Sound section, you will see an option to allow or block sites from playing sound.
By default, sound is allowed, but autoplay may still be restricted. To ensure autoplay is allowed, scroll down to Allowed to play sound and click Add next to it.
Add Specific Site:

In the text field that appears, enter the URL of the website where you want to allow autoplay (e.g., https://example.com).
Click Add.
Now, Chrome will allow that site to autoplay audio when you visit it. If the audio is still muted or blocked for any reason, the browser might require an additional user interaction before playing sound on that specific page.
